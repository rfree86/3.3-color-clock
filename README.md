# 3.3-color-clock
This project was an experiment at manipulating CSS with JavaScript. This clock has a couple different features. The background changes with the time using hexadecimal colors. Also, when you highlight the time, the display will change to the hexadecimal value used to create the background. The last feature is a bar that grows as the seconds get closer to completing a full minute and shrinks again on the minute change.
